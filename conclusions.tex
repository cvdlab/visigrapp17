\section{\uppercase{Conclusions}}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent
In this paper we have introduced a software architecture and framework to be used in  design for building deconstruction. The immediate goal is to provide an advanced web-service for quantity surveyors, called  to make reliable and accurate estimates of economic and environmental returns from unused buildings, according to new waste material regulations and to policies for land use control.

The reader may have easily seen that the Metior framework can be used also as a very simplified BIM instrument for renovation projects in existing buildings, and even for new design projects.  The Metior project---currently in advanced prototype development---is based on the most advanced technologies for web services and applications, and on recent developments in geometric computing. 
It is worth-noting that Metior might easily provide an excellent project basis for more demanding undertakings, in particular in a national scene in strong need for new large programs of renovation and seismic adaptation of its built heritage.
