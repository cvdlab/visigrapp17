\section{\uppercase{Conclusions}}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent
In this paper we have introduced a software architecture and framework to be used in  design for building deconstruction. The immediate goal is to provide an advanced web-service for quantity surveyors, called  to make reliable and accurate estimates of economic and environmental returns from unused buildings, according to new waste material regulations and to policies for land use control.
The reader may have easily seen that such framework can be also used as a very simplified BIM tool for renovation projects in existing buildings and even for new design projects. It is worth-noting that the Metior project---currently in advanced phase of prototype development---since based on the most advanced technologies for web apps, and on best developments in geometric computing, might easily provide an excellent conceptual basis for more demanding projects, in particular in a national scene in strong need for new large programs of renovation and seismic adaptation of its built heritage.
